# Expense-Tracker-4
This project helps beginners practice file handling, data storage, and basic logic building in Python while learning how to manage real-world data efficiently.


The Expense Tracker is a simple Python-based program that helps users record and manage their daily expenses easily from the terminal. It uses a CSV file to store all expense details, making it lightweight and easy to use without any database setup.

Features:

Add Expense: Enter expense name and amount, and it’s saved automatically.

View Expenses: Displays all expenses with their total amount.

Data Storage: Saves data in a CSV file (expenses.csv) for future reference.

Exit Option: Allows you to close the program safely anytime.

Technology Used:

Python (CSV module, file handling, and loops)

How It Works:

Run the program.

Choose an option — Add Expense, View Expenses, or Exit.

Each expense gets saved to expenses.csv.

When you view expenses, the program calculates and displays the total amount spent.
